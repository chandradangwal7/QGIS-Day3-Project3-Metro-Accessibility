# QGIS Day 3 – Project 3: Bangalore Metro Accessibility (1 km Buffer)

This mini-project explores how many people live within **1 km of Bangalore Metro stations** using QGIS basic geoprocessing tools.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
- **Objective:** Estimate metro accessibility based on a simple 1 km radius around stations.
- **Data Used:**  
  - Bangalore city boundary and metro stations (from OpenStreetMap via QuickOSM)  
  - WorldPop 2020 constrained population raster (100m resolution)
- **Tools:** QGIS (buffer, reprojection, zonal statistics), OpenStreetMap (QuickOSM plugin)
- **CRS Used:** EPSG:32643 (UTM Zone 43N) for accurate distance operations; reprojected back to EPSG:4326 for sharing.

## 🛠 Workflow Summary
1. **Downloaded** Bangalore boundary and metro station points using QuickOSM.
2. **Filtered** metro stations by operator: *Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited*.
3. **Reprojected** layers to EPSG:32643 (meters-based CRS).
4. **Created buffer** of 1 km around metro stations and dissolved boundaries.
5. **Used Zonal Statistics** to calculate population within the buffer using WorldPop raster.
6. **Exported** final map and results; reprojected back to EPSG:4326 for sharing.

## 📊 Key Insights & Notes
- The buffer currently uses **straight-line distance**, so it may include water bodies or highways.
- **Future plan:** Use **OpenRouteService (ORS)** to calculate walkable network buffers for more realistic results.
