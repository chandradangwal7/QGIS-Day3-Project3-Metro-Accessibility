# QGIS Day 3 – Metro Accessibility Project (Mini Project 3)

## 1. Project Overview
This project explores **metro station accessibility** in Bangalore using **QGIS**.  
It focuses on:
- Mapping Bangalore metro and railway stations.
- Creating **1 km buffer zones** around metro stations.
- Analyzing population distribution within these buffers.
- Visualizing accessibility results and exporting outputs.

This is my **third mini project on Day 3** of QGIS learning.

## 3. Data Sources
- **Metro & Railway Stations:** Extracted using OSM plugin in QGIS.
- **Population Data:** WorldPop (2020), reprojected for analysis.
- **Other Layers:** Public amenities and buffer layers created during analysis.

## 4. Methodology
1. Imported metro, railway, and population layers into QGIS.
2. Reprojected all layers to a common CRS (meters).
3. Created **1 km buffers** around each metro station.
4. Performed **zonal statistics** to calculate population inside each buffer.
5. Styled the map with appropriate symbology and labels.
6. Exported outputs in PNG and PDF formats.

## 6. Improvements & Next Steps
- Incorporate **OpenRouteService (ORS)** to measure exact **walkable 1 km distance** accounting for bridges and highways.
- Automate analysis workflows in **Advanced QGIS** (next learning step).
- Explore advanced visualization techniques for better decision support.

## 7. Learning Notes
- Completed **Introduction to QGIS (Full Course)** by Spatial Thoughts.
- Next: **Advanced QGIS – Automating GIS Workflows & Visualizations** by Ujaval Gandhi.
